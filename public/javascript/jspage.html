    <h3>Intro into NodeJS understanding foundation of Javascript</h3>
    <p>Our first week of NodeJS we had brushed up on our Javascript skills, we learned the basics of do's and dont's
      using JS when now we were learning of NodeJS </p>
    <p>The teacher here gave the students a very important notice on the importance of the classes, and what was
      expected of the students regarding this class.</p>
    <p>Alot of the talk was about conventions and expentance of knowledge of conventions such as naming and clean code.
    </p>
    <p>REST Api Conventions are also a necessity, as the products become larger and larger, its important to understand
      where is what.</p>
    <p>The expentance here was more inclined to the knowledge of that the GET ALL function lies on top of everything but
      here is a small summary of the contents:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>GET all - The function to fetch all elements</li>
      <li>GET one - the function to fetch a single element using an ID</li>
      <li>POST - send request creating a new element</li>
      <li>PATCH - patching parts of a single element (we use this so we dont, flood the internet and server with
        unecessary bandwidth), using an ID</li>
      <li>PUT - patch/update the entirety of a single element, basically recreating it from scratch, using an id.</li>
      <li>DELETE - Deletes a single element using an ID</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div id="week2" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Scope and Start NodeJS!</h3>
    <p>The Teacher spoke and brushed the students of how scoping works, being in global scope, function scope, block
      scope and the importance of using functions </p>
    <p>We were introduced to ESLint we continued to talk about basic JS, and how to propperly use it, we then went into
      creating objects, arrays and functions.</p>
    <p>We also learned what is JSON and understood its significance and simplicity, we were also shown XML for
      reference. </p>
    <p>We worked abit with express and started working on our first NodeJS interaction and understanding further the use
      and
      power of the language.</p>
    <p>We concretely we made a port connection with a callback function (in several different ways) which allows us to
      handle errors.</p>
    <p>additionally we worked with setting up our own package.json so that we can install necessary dependencies using
      npm</p>
    <p>Which is also another skill we learned how to propperly look and find the documentation for npm</p>
    </p>
    <p>And obvisouly as working with npm we also learned about node_modules, what they are and about how express is a
      lightweight language.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="week3" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>CRUD REST Api, networking, loops and Nodemon!</h3>
    <p>We continued with the Mountains API now implementing POST requests, serving html and working with URLs.</p>
    <p>The teacher also dissect the URL teaching us about the protocol, subdomain, domain name, top-level-domain, path
      and possibly a query.</p>
    <p>we worked for quite some time on perfecting our mastery of loops and how to create the right loops so we avoid
      errors.</p>
    <p>we also trained to work lists using maps, reduce and filters.</p>
    <p>additionally learning and understood the need for body parsing</p>
  </div>
  <div id="week4" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Time to Deploy!</h3>
    <p>I wasnt in school that day saddly, but I did read on the subject and sucesffully launched a static page on Vercel
      using the help provided by the teacher.</p>
    <p>We had an assignment to learn how to work with date, getting different date types which was the topic of my
      vercel site: </p>
    <a href="https://node-js-deploy2.vercel.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
      title="Link to my static site on vercel using node and express">Vercel shows when new years is at</a></p>
    <p>My colleagues told me also they implemented the last parts of the CRUDable Mountain API we were creating since
      the 2nd week.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="week5" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>XSS, Import and Export</h3>
    <p>The lesson of the week was in the different methods on importing and exporting modules in NodeJS, we learned the
      legacy method in case we were going to take care of such a system</p>
    <div class="pre-container">
      <pre>We were also introduced to the dangers of cross site scripting attacks, that plagues the internet, and learned
      that we can sanitize it rather simply by changing html elements that could be used for scripting using html to change
      the following:
     from | to 
      &   | & amp;
      <   | & lt;
      >   | & gt;
      "   | & quot;
      '   | & #x27;
    But without the space in between the ampersand, doing abit of digging ive also learned that we have options like
     using sanitation modules for NodeJS. this is not fail proof but definitely helps alot.</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div id="week6" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>Serverside vs Clientside redirects and fetching</h3>
    <p>In this week we learned some differences on how to serve websites and redirect whether we do it on the client
      side</p>
    <p>or to do it in the Serverside, the same goes about fetching, learning the differences in what we wish of the
      website.</p>
    <p>One could argue about the major difference is whether you are creating an internal website for your workers, or
      its a </p>
    <p>website made for a business that wishes to be seen online by SEO robots. there are also some difference in
      loadtimes.</p>
    <p>We were also taught how to structure our folders when creating fullstack applications.</p>
  </div>
  <div id="week7" class="tabcontent">
    <h3>SSR, Env-Var, Filesystem read/write</h3>
    <p>The lesson was about SSR and CSR, learning about Env-Var, where and when its needed
      (guessing especifically for DB connections and other sensitive info?),</p>
    <p>I was sadly not there for the lessons but read up on it online and got some intel from colleagues</p>
    <p>and how to implement filesystem files and read and write to them.</p>
    <p>we were also instructed to learn basic Svelte through their learning webpage.</p>
